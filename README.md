# Mixed Messages - Codecademy Portfolio Project
This repository contains my solution to the Mixed Messages project on Codecademy, as part of my progress through the Front End career path on Codecademy Pro.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a JavaScript program which generates a random message each time the user runs it. This program will be versioned using Git and Github, and will be developed using the macOS Terminal and VSCode locally on my Macbook Pro, which is the first time I would've undertaken a project this way.

## Usage
This project is intended to create a random weather generator, which when run by the user will output a sentence containing a random city, day and weather. The data will be selected from predefined arrays, stored in an object.

## Why are there two Mixed Messages files?
I initally made this project very quickly, without using any objects or iteration, and only used one array (the other data in the sentence was numbers, each of which was randomly generated). Having read some solutions, I decided to further challenge myself by recreating the project with some more advanced JavaScript techniques. Therefore, the second Mixed Messages file is slightly more technical!

## Technologies
- Javascript
- Node
