# Mixed Messages - Codecademy Portfolio Project
This repository contains my solution to the Mixed Messages project on Codecademy, as part of my progress through the Front End career path on Codecademy Pro.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a JavaScript program which generates a random message each time the user runs it. This program will be versioned using Git and Github, and will be developed using the macOS Terminal and VSCode locally on my Macbook Pro, which is the first time I would've undertaken a project this way.
